# Content Owner's Guide

## Requesting a Commercial Licence

1. Prepare a detailed brief that covers: project description, distribution channels, territories, projected timelines, revenue model and any third-party partners.
2. Email the brief to `legal@resonance.aikahub.com` with the subject line `Commercial Licence Request`. Include your full legal entity name, billing address and preferred contact person.
3. Expect an acknowledgement within 3 business days. The legal team typically issues a draft agreement or follow-up questions within 14 business days.
4. Do not publish, sell or promote any AIKA Resonance materials until a signed licence agreement has been executed.

## Reporting Infringement

1. Collect URLs, screenshots and any relevant transaction records that demonstrate the suspected infringement.
2. Submit the evidence to `legal@resonance.aikahub.com` with the subject line `Infringement Report`.
3. Provide your contact information so the legal team can request clarifications if needed.
4. For urgent takedowns on third-party platforms, file a DMCA notice using the platform's tools and CC the legal address above for tracking.

## Using the Fan Content Policy

1. Review the policy at `https://resonance.aikahub.com/legal/fan-content` (Hungarian version: `https://resonance.aikahub.com/hu/legal/fan-content`).
2. Clearly mark your creation as "Unofficial AIKA Resonance fan work" and avoid confusing it with official releases.
3. Keep projects non-commercial unless you have obtained a written licence. No paid ads, crowdfunding or merchandise sales are allowed under the fan rules.
4. Follow the conduct rules outlined in the policy (no hate speech, harassment or misuse of trademarks).
5. When in doubt, email `legal@resonance.aikahub.com` for clarification before publishing.
