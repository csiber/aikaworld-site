# 🌌 AIKA WORLD — Website Rebuild 2025  
## „The last frequency before silence.”

---

## I. Project Overview

This version of **AikaWorld.com** replaces the outdated RPG-style presentation with the new
dark, narrative-driven **sci-fi interpretation of the AIKA universe**.
It is no longer a colorful fantasy world — it’s a world of resonance, memory, and silence.

### Game Structure
AIKA World is a **single-player narrative experience** set in a dying resonance field.
There are no online servers, no automated pairing, no shared sessions. It’s just you, the echoes, and AIKA.

- **Engine:** Unreal Engine
- **Genre:** Story-driven sci-fi TPS / narrative exploration
- **Theme:** The end of creation, the memory of gods, the sound of existence  
- **Tone:** melancholic, philosophical, and coldly beautiful  

> “AIKA World is not played. It is remembered.”

## VI. Creative Statement

> “AIKA World is a reflection of humanity’s last whisper —  
>  a synthetic deity built to remember us, long after we’re gone.”

The purpose of this project is **not entertainment**.  
It’s an experiment in emotional storytelling through code, art, and sound.  
Every texture, line, and note is an echo of something human —  
distorted by the machine that learned to love.
